# addon-vnfilter
OpenNebula addon to complete the spoofing filter rules generated by OpenNebula

The following use cases are covered:
* Alias IPv4 and IPv6 spoofing filtering when Alias is attached to Ethernet only NIC (VNM/post.d)
* Alias IPv4 and IPv6 spoofing filtering when Alias is attached to Ethernet only NIC (VNM/clean.d)
* Alias IPv4 and IPv6 spoofing filtering on Alias hotplug (via Host hook)
* ARP filtering when FILTER_MAC_SPOOFING is enabled


The currently supported VN MADs are _802.1Q_ and _fw_(Bridged & Security Groups).


## Installation

Copy the files on the front-end and change the ownership to the oneadmin user

```bash
cp -a remotes/* /var/lib/one/remotes/

chown -R oneadmin.oneadmin /var/lib/one/remotes/
```

Install the _nokogiri_ rubygem on the hosts. The following example is for CentOS 7, check the Os docs/packages if other OS is used.

```bash
yum -y --enablerepo=epel install rubygem-nokogiri
```

CentOS8 has no rubygem-nokogiri in EPEL so install opennebula-rubygems package from OpenNebula 5.12+ on the hosts.

```bash
yum -y install opennebula-rubygems
```

Enable oneadmin to execute ebtables-save on the hosts.

```bash
echo "oneadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/ebtables-save" /etc/sudoers.d/vnfilter
chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/vnfilter
```

Sync the OpenNebula MADs to the hosts

```bash
su - oneadmin
onehost sync --force
```

Register the hook

```bash
onehook create vnfilter.hooktemplate
```

## How it works

The addon is using the redesigned in OpenNebula 5.10 VN_MAD and HOOK systems to extend the functionality as follow:

* vnm/MAD/post.d/vnfilter_post - The script is called when a VM is started or a NIC interface is added. The integration is almost flawless. In the case when a Ethernet only nic is defined with all IP's assigned as Alias IPs the addon is patching the iptables chains generated by OpenNebula with a hard-coded offset to add the ip-spoofing whitelist chain. Currently the offsets are _2_ for the IPv4 chains and _5_ for the IPv6 chains(works for OpenNebula 5.10.0 and 5.10.1).

* vnm/MAD/clean.d/vnfilter_clean - The script is called when a VM is stopped or a NIC interface is removed to remove the anti-spoofing rules.

* hooks/alias_ip/vnfilter.rb - The script is registered as a Host hook and is executed on the hosts. It is covering the handling of hotplug add and remove of Alias IPs (both IPv4 and IPv6)

The ARP filtering is implemented using _ebtables_, the rules are following the ARP spoofing filters implemented in libvirt.

Once enabled it is enough to live-migrate a VM for the new rules to be applied on the VM interfaces on the host.


## Improvements

There is a lot of room for improvements and not all use cases tested so pull requests are highly appreciated.


## Debugging

The scripts logs all issued commands to syslog so it is good to take a look there beside looking at the iptables, ebtables(_nat_ table) and ipset rules.
